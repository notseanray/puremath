# todo list, in no particular order

***all items are tentative and might not happen ever***

- square-root and natural-log objects for more exact storage

- polynomial long division

- manual approximation for derivatives and integrals using the limit definition and riemann sums (for functions that are literally functions in python)?

- quaternions! *(probably in their own special world because main.py is set up for complex objects specifically)*

- fraction objects (already coded) with decimal function, along with other number-related functions
