# todo list, in no particular order

***all items are tentative and might not happen ever***

- polynomial long division

- quaternions! *(probably in their own special world because main.py is set up for complex objects specifically)*

- rational-number or fraction objects (for exact numbers), with square-root and/or natural-log objects for irrational

- 4D coordinate objects with 4D rotation! project into 3D space and then project that into 2D space -_-

- translation support for coordinate objects and wireframes
