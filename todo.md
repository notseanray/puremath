# todo list, in no particular order

***all items are tentative and might not happen ever***

- fix input range for ln(x) because it gives sussy outputs at certain inputs

- complex numbers as r*e^ix *(after ln(x) is range-fixed)*

- square-root objects, where irrational roots of a polynomial can be stored exactly?

- polynomial long division

- complex exponentiation *(only once ln(x) is range-fixed)*

- natural log objects perhaps, just to store them more exactly?

- manual approximation for derivatives and integrals using the limit definition and riemann sums (for functions that are literally functions in python)?

- quaternions! *(probably in their own special world because main.py is set up for complex objects specifically)*
