# todo list, in no particular order

***all items are tentative and might not happen ever***

- make ppm image rendering un-cancerous

- polynomial long division

- define more functions for quaternions

- rational-number or fraction objects (for exact numbers), with square-root and/or natural-log objects for irrational

- 4D coordinate objects with 4D rotation! project into 3D space and then project that into 2D space -_-

- integrate quaternions with reals and comps

- compund ppm files into a video for real-time translation and rotation

- z*z + c fractals in ppm
